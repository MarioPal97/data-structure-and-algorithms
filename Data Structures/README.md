# Data Structures

## Abstract Data Type
An Abstract Data Type is an abstraction of Data Structures which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
The interface doesn't give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language. 

| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS) |
| --- | --- |
| List | - Dynamic Array |
| | - Linked List |
| Queue | - Linked list Based Queue |
| | - Array Based Queue |
| | - Stack Based Queue |
| Map | - Tree Map |
| | - Hash Map / Hash Table |

## Computational Complexity Analysis
There are only two things on which everything in Computer Science depends
- ```Time Complexity : The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of computer time it needs to run to completion. ``` 
- ```Space Complexity : The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of memory it needs to run to completion. ``` 

    ### Big-O Notation
    It gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case.
